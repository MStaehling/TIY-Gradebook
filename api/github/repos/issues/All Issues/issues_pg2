You'll need to create a new repository called TIY-Github* and populate it with the usual **README.md** and **LICENSE** file. Then create a branch called `yak-shaving` that adds the following tree:\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n- [x] api/\\\r\\\n - [x] github/\\\r\\\n  - [x] users/\\\r\\\n   - [x] dist/\\\r\\\n     - [x] .gitignore \\\r\\\n- [x] specs/\\\r\\\n- [x] src/\\\r\\\n- [x] scss/\\\r\\\n- [x] tests/\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n- [x] Use your init commands to create `bower.json` and `package.json` files at the top of the repository (i.e. NOT insrc/), and use `Yeoman` to initialize `H5BP` and `Mocha` into `src/`. Create a `.gitignore` in `dist/` that **excludes everything except itself**.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n- [x] **Skitch this Profile**\\\r\\\n - [x] Grab a screenshot of your profile page using Skitch and save it to specs/profile.png. \\\r\\\n - [x] Break down the layout into pieces and export them with the profile- prefix into specs/. \\\r\\\n - [x] For example, `specs/profile-repositories.png` might be the Repositories section of your profile. \\\r\\\n - [ ] Make lots of these.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n- [x] **API Gymnastics:**\\\r\\\n - [x] Fetch the profile data for user octocat and store it in api/github/users/octocat.json, then fetch the repository data and save it to api/github/users/octocat/repos.json. What other data can you identify in your profile? Can you fetch that data, too?\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n- [x] **Follow the Script!**\\\r\\\n - [x] Add script definitions to your package.json for start and test that run browser-sync appropriately: watch the right files, start in the right place, etc.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n- [x] **npm install --global:**\\\r\\\n - [x] `wiredep`\\\r\\\n - [x] `node-sass`\\\r\\\n- [x] **bower install:**\\\r\\\n - [x] `pure`\\\r\\\n - [x] `jquery`\\\r\\\n - [x] `lodash`"
