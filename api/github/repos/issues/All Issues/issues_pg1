Which are dynamic?\\\r\\\n  * What will change between products? What will stay the same?\\\r\\\n  * What data will we need? How can we get it?\\\r\\\n* **Start with _canned_ data...**\\\r\\\n  * Use `jQuery.getJSON` to _request_ some data...\\\r\\\n  * Sanity Check: The Network Panel\\\r\\\n  * Chain a callback with `.then`...\\\r\\\n  * Sanity Check: tracer bullet / `debugger` statement\\\r\\\n  * What do we do with it?\\\r\\\n* **What does the data _look_ like?**\\\r\\\n  * How is it structured? What fields exist in the data?\\\r\\\n  * Which fields do we need for `product.html`?\\\r\\\n  * What values do those fields contain?\\\r\\\n  * Do we need to request any additional data? How?\\\r\\\n* **Where does the data _live_ on our page?**\\\r\\\n  * What HTML structures contain _dynamic_ data?\\\r\\\n  * What can we replace with placeholders?\\\r\\\n  * What placeholders should we use?\\\r\\\n* **Small-to-big, inside-to-outside...**\\\r\\\n  * What is the _smallest_ HTML structure that we can select?\\\r\\\n  * What data do we need to replace inside that HTML?\\\r\\\n  * Bind the data:\\\r\\\n    * Create a `Vue` instance...\\\r\\\n    * Select the HTML element...\\\r\\\n    * Attach the data.\\\r\\\n  * Can we easily expand the scope, either...\\\r\\\n    * ...to include _more_ HTML?\\\r\\\n    * ...to replace _more_ data?\\\r\\\n* **Let me repeat myself...**\\\r\\\n  * What if I have to [display a _collection_ of data](http://vuejs.org/guide/list.html)?\\\r\\\n  * Start simply: `collection[0]` as the first `item`\\\r\\\n    * Add placeholders for the first item using `collection[0]`\\\r\\\n    * Ensure the single item replaces correctly\\\r\\\n    * Loop over _all_ items with `v-repeat`...\\\r\\\n* **The State of Slideshow Bob**\\\r\\\n  * Which slide is `.active`...? How do I indicate that?\\\r\\\n    * **VIEW:** Define an `.active` style rule and defaults for \"inactive\" slides...\\\r\\\n    * **MODEL:** Start with an `active` value in `data` set to `0` (the first slide)\\\r\\\n    * Use [`v-class`](http://vuejs.org/api/directives.html#v-class) to add `.active`...\\\r\\\n    * ...but not to _every_ image, right?\\\r\\\n    * Only add `.active`(CSS) if `$index` is `active` (JS)!\\\r\\\n  * But that's so ugly! Refactor!\\\r\\\n    * Add `isActive` to the [`methods`](http://vuejs.org/api/options.html#methods)...\\\r\\\n      * inputs?\\\r\\\n      * outputs?\\\r\\\n      * side-effects?\\\r\\\n    * Replace `active == $index` with `isActive($index)`\\\r\\\n    * It works!
