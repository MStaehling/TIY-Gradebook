You've learned a lot in a very short amount of time. Take some time tonight to review your notes and write them down. Use whatever format helps you get the ideas out: bulleted lists, stream of consciousness, retelling a story. Consider this a draft that you'll revise a few times throughout the week. Put this work in a branch called `journal-week-1` in your `USERNAME.github.io` repo. Don't forget to link to that PR in your _WIP Issue_! Here are some suggestions for topics:\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n* What do developers do? What principles of a developer have you learned?\\\r\\\n* Explain the outside-in and inside-out technique we employed for TodoCLI.\\\r\\\n* Describe the technique of using User Stories to write application specifications.\\\r\\\n* Write something about the principle of Extreme Programming (XP) called YAGNI.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nIf you're looking to get a leg up on the material for the week, start investigating the DOM and\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n### GitHubbing to Know You, Part 2\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nThis week, you'll be randomly assigned classmates to interrogate and a question to ask. Then, you get to update _their_ Markdown file in the Student Roster and open a PR for the change. Chances are high (i.e. I rigged it) that the person you get _won't_ get assigned you... fun, right? You'll know all kinds of embarassing details about each other in no time!\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n### Making Blueprints\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nSome of your homework assignments for the week will be duplicating functionality based on a [reference implementation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_implementation).\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n* Create directories for `NestedAccordion`, `FullWidthTabs`, and `QuotesRotator`\\\r\\\n* try `git add` on empty directories: what happens? why do you think? what can you find about it?\\\r\\\n* copy example code: HTML into `index.html`, CSS into `styles.css`, JS into `scripts.js`\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n#### BEAST MODE\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nIf you open the `index.html` files that you just made in a browser you'll run into some problems. Can you fix them so that they work _exactly_ like the demo sites?\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n### Prep for TodoMVC\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nTomorrow, we'll start building [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) with plain \"vanilla\" JavaScript in the browser. To get ready, you'll need to [download the starter template from Github](). Create a new repo on Github called `TIY-TodoMVC` and commit and push the contents of the starter template to `master`. Then review the [application specifications]() and examine some of the reference implementations.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n#### BEAST MODE\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nIf you open the `index.html` file from the starter template in a browser, it probably won't look like much. Can you get it working? There's probably a `README` file lying around somewhere that can help you.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n## Resources\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n* [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com)\\\r\\\n  * [starter template on Github](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc-app-template) ([download](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc-app-template/archive/master.zip))\\\r\\\n  * [project specifications](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/app-spec.md)\\\r\\\n* References for DOM JavaScript\\\r\\\n  * [_Document Object Model_ on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model)\\\r\\\n  * [_Interactive Web Pages with JavaScript_ on Team Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/interactive-web-pages-with-javascript)\\\r\\\n  * [_Try jQuery_ on Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-jquery)\\\r\\\n* [_Blueprints_ articles on Tympanus.net](http://tympanus.net/codrops/category/blueprints/)\\\r\\\n  * [Nested Accordion](http://tympanus.net/Blueprints/NestedAccordion/)\\\r\\\n  * [Full Width Tabs](http://tympanus.net/Blueprints/FullWidthTabs/)\\\r\\\n  * [Quotes Rotator](http://tympanus.net/Blueprints/QuotesRotator/)"
