Which are dynamic?\\\r\\\n  * What will change between products? What will stay the same?\\\r\\\n  * What data will we need? How can we get it?\\\r\\\n* **Start with _canned_ data...**\\\r\\\n  * Use `jQuery.getJSON` to _request_ some data...\\\r\\\n  * Sanity Check: The Network Panel\\\r\\\n  * Chain a callback with `.then`...\\\r\\\n  * Sanity Check: tracer bullet / `debugger` statement\\\r\\\n  * What do we do with it?\\\r\\\n* **What does the data _look_ like?**\\\r\\\n  * How is it structured? What fields exist in the data?\\\r\\\n  * Which fields do we need for `product.html`?\\\r\\\n  * What values do those fields contain?\\\r\\\n  * Do we need to request any additional data? How?\\\r\\\n* **Where does the data _live_ on our page?**\\\r\\\n  * What HTML structures contain _dynamic_ data?\\\r\\\n  * What can we replace with placeholders?\\\r\\\n  * What placeholders should we use?\\\r\\\n* **Small-to-big, inside-to-outside...**\\\r\\\n  * What is the _smallest_ HTML structure that we can select?\\\r\\\n  * What data do we need to replace inside that HTML?\\\r\\\n  * Bind the data:\\\r\\\n    * Create a `Vue` instance...\\\r\\\n    * Select the HTML element...\\\r\\\n    * Attach the data.\\\r\\\n  * Can we easily expand the scope, either...\\\r\\\n    * ...to include _more_ HTML?\\\r\\\n    * ...to replace _more_ data?\\\r\\\n* **Let me repeat myself...**\\\r\\\n  * What if I have to [display a _collection_ of data](http://vuejs.org/guide/list.html)?\\\r\\\n  * Start simply: `collection[0]` as the first `item`\\\r\\\n    * Add placeholders for the first item using `collection[0]`\\\r\\\n    * Ensure the single item replaces correctly\\\r\\\n    * Loop over _all_ items with `v-repeat`...\\\r\\\n* **The State of Slideshow Bob**\\\r\\\n  * Which slide is `.active`...? How do I indicate that?\\\r\\\n    * **VIEW:** Define an `.active` style rule and defaults for \"inactive\" slides...\\\r\\\n    * **MODEL:** Start with an `active` value in `data` set to `0` (the first slide)\\\r\\\n    * Use [`v-class`](http://vuejs.org/api/directives.html#v-class) to add `.active`...\\\r\\\n    * ...but not to _every_ image, right?\\\r\\\n    * Only add `.active`(CSS) if `$index` is `active` (JS)!\\\r\\\n  * But that's so ugly! Refactor!\\\r\\\n    * Add `isActive` to the [`methods`](http://vuejs.org/api/options.html#methods)...\\\r\\\n      * inputs?\\\r\\\n      * outputs?\\\r\\\n      * side-effects?\\\r\\\n    * Replace `active == $index` with `isActive($index)`\\\r\\\n    * It works!

You'll need to create a new repository called TIY-Github* and populate it with the usual **README.md** and **LICENSE** file. Then create a branch called `yak-shaving` that adds the following tree:\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n- [x] api/\\\r\\\n - [x] github/\\\r\\\n  - [x] users/\\\r\\\n   - [x] dist/\\\r\\\n     - [x] .gitignore \\\r\\\n- [x] specs/\\\r\\\n- [x] src/\\\r\\\n- [x] scss/\\\r\\\n- [x] tests/\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n- [x] Use your init commands to create `bower.json` and `package.json` files at the top of the repository (i.e. NOT insrc/), and use `Yeoman` to initialize `H5BP` and `Mocha` into `src/`. Create a `.gitignore` in `dist/` that **excludes everything except itself**.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n- [x] **Skitch this Profile**\\\r\\\n - [x] Grab a screenshot of your profile page using Skitch and save it to specs/profile.png. \\\r\\\n - [x] Break down the layout into pieces and export them with the profile- prefix into specs/. \\\r\\\n - [x] For example, `specs/profile-repositories.png` might be the Repositories section of your profile. \\\r\\\n - [ ] Make lots of these.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n- [x] **API Gymnastics:**\\\r\\\n - [x] Fetch the profile data for user octocat and store it in api/github/users/octocat.json, then fetch the repository data and save it to api/github/users/octocat/repos.json. What other data can you identify in your profile? Can you fetch that data, too?\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n- [x] **Follow the Script!**\\\r\\\n - [x] Add script definitions to your package.json for start and test that run browser-sync appropriately: watch the right files, start in the right place, etc.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n- [x] **npm install --global:**\\\r\\\n - [x] `wiredep`\\\r\\\n - [x] `node-sass`\\\r\\\n- [x] **bower install:**\\\r\\\n - [x] `pure`\\\r\\\n - [x] `jquery`\\\r\\\n - [x] `lodash`"

You've learned a lot in a very short amount of time. Take some time tonight to review your notes and write them down. Use whatever format helps you get the ideas out: bulleted lists, stream of consciousness, retelling a story. Consider this a draft that you'll revise a few times throughout the week. Put this work in a branch called `journal-week-1` in your `USERNAME.github.io` repo. Don't forget to link to that PR in your _WIP Issue_! Here are some suggestions for topics:\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n* What do developers do? What principles of a developer have you learned?\\\r\\\n* Explain the outside-in and inside-out technique we employed for TodoCLI.\\\r\\\n* Describe the technique of using User Stories to write application specifications.\\\r\\\n* Write something about the principle of Extreme Programming (XP) called YAGNI.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nIf you're looking to get a leg up on the material for the week, start investigating the DOM and\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n### GitHubbing to Know You, Part 2\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nThis week, you'll be randomly assigned classmates to interrogate and a question to ask. Then, you get to update _their_ Markdown file in the Student Roster and open a PR for the change. Chances are high (i.e. I rigged it) that the person you get _won't_ get assigned you... fun, right? You'll know all kinds of embarassing details about each other in no time!\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n### Making Blueprints\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nSome of your homework assignments for the week will be duplicating functionality based on a [reference implementation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_implementation).\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n* Create directories for `NestedAccordion`, `FullWidthTabs`, and `QuotesRotator`\\\r\\\n* try `git add` on empty directories: what happens? why do you think? what can you find about it?\\\r\\\n* copy example code: HTML into `index.html`, CSS into `styles.css`, JS into `scripts.js`\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n#### BEAST MODE\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nIf you open the `index.html` files that you just made in a browser you'll run into some problems. Can you fix them so that they work _exactly_ like the demo sites?\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n### Prep for TodoMVC\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nTomorrow, we'll start building [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) with plain \"vanilla\" JavaScript in the browser. To get ready, you'll need to [download the starter template from Github](). Create a new repo on Github called `TIY-TodoMVC` and commit and push the contents of the starter template to `master`. Then review the [application specifications]() and examine some of the reference implementations.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n#### BEAST MODE\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nIf you open the `index.html` file from the starter template in a browser, it probably won't look like much. Can you get it working? There's probably a `README` file lying around somewhere that can help you.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n## Resources\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n* [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com)\\\r\\\n  * [starter template on Github](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc-app-template) ([download](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc-app-template/archive/master.zip))\\\r\\\n  * [project specifications](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/app-spec.md)\\\r\\\n* References for DOM JavaScript\\\r\\\n  * [_Document Object Model_ on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model)\\\r\\\n  * [_Interactive Web Pages with JavaScript_ on Team Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/interactive-web-pages-with-javascript)\\\r\\\n  * [_Try jQuery_ on Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-jquery)\\\r\\\n* [_Blueprints_ articles on Tympanus.net](http://tympanus.net/codrops/category/blueprints/)\\\r\\\n  * [Nested Accordion](http://tympanus.net/Blueprints/NestedAccordion/)\\\r\\\n  * [Full Width Tabs](http://tympanus.net/Blueprints/FullWidthTabs/)\\\r\\\n  * [Quotes Rotator](http://tympanus.net/Blueprints/QuotesRotator/)"

Through this process, the author revises her stance on the organization and presentation of the ideas in the piece, also revising her outline in the process. Your next step towards your essay is to produce your first Rough Draft, although you might produce many. Keep them all in the `growth-vs-fixed-mindset.md` file, adding commits for each as you go. _Don't clobber your outline!_ Keep it around and revise it as you go. In the next stage, you'll start revising your drafts and outline into your final essay.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n* Write _at least 1_ Rough Draft in `growth-vs-fixed-mindset.md`\\\r\\\n* Keep _all_ drafts you author; commit _at least once_ for each.\\\r\\\n* _Leave your outline!_ Revise it based on your drafts.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n### Reading JavaScript\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nTonight, add 10 more entries to `about/javascript.md` for some of the operators we covered today in class, and particularly include that weirdo: `typeof`. There are some others like him in the documentation; bonus points for covering some crazy cousins. Also include coverage of the `function` keyword and include examples of function definitions _and_ invocations. Identify the pieces and parts of your examples with code comments. If you're struggling with the format of your documentation, try following the example below:\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n* add 10 more entries to `about/javascript.md`\\\r\\\n* cover any operators that we used in class that seemed odd or confusing\\\r\\\n* include the `typeof` operator\\\r\\\n* include the `function` keyword,\\\r\\\n  * provide examples of function definitions and invocations\\\r\\\n  * identify the pieces of your examples with code comments\\\r\\\n* incorporate feedback from Assignment 01\\\r\\\n* use the format below, if it's helpful\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n#### Sample Format\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n```markdown\\\r\\\n# About JavaScript\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n## Operators\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n### Arithmetic\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n#### `+` -- addition\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nGiven two `Number` values, produces the sum of those values as another `Number`. For example:\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n    1 + 1 // yields 2\\\r\\\n    2 + 2 // yields 4\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n. . .\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n## Functions\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nFunctions are a form of [control flow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow) used in computer programs... (you fill in the rest)\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n### `function` keyword\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nThe `function` keyword is used to _define_ a function with parentheses and curly braces:\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n    // This is a Function Definition for `whatever`...\\\r\\\n    function whatever ( /* arguments go here */ ) {\\\r\\\n      // body of function goes here\\\r\\\n    }\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nOnce a function has been defined, it can be _invoked_ by... (get the picture?)\\\r\\\n```\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n### JavaScript Koans\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nA [koan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dan) is \"a story, dialogue, question, or statement which is used in Zen practice to ... test a student's progress.\" Many people have contributed to sets of koans for learning programming languages, as well. [The JavaScript Koans maintained by David Laing](https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans) are good practice problems to help you gauge your understanding of JavaScript. Fork and clone his repository so that you can work on the problems locally. Just opening the `KoansRunner.html` file in a browser is sufficient (`open KoansRunner.html`); remember to reload the page after you save!\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nCreate a branch in your cloned fork called `02--tools-on-tuesday` and commit your work to that branch. Push your branch to Github (`git push`) and open a Pull Request _from_ your `02--tools-on-tuesday` branch _into_ the `master` branch of _your fork_... not the original. Didn't you know you could do that? Remember to link your open PR to your _WIP Issue_ in the class repo!\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n* fork https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans\\\r\\\n* clone _your fork_ locally\\\r\\\n* create and checkout a branch named `02--tools-on-tuesday`\\\r\\\n* open `KoanRunner.html` in a browser\\\r\\\n* complete `AboutExpects.js`, `AboutArrays.js`, `AboutFunctions.js`\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n#### BEAST MODE\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nIn addition to **NORMAL MODE**, complete `AboutObjects.js`, `AboutMutability.js`, `AboutHigherOrderFunctions.js` as well.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n#### NIGHTMARE MODE\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nComplete _all_ of the koans.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n## Additional Resources"

    "body": "# 00 -- Brace Yourself... It's gonna be a bumpy ride.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nMost of this assignment is getting your laptop ready for Day 1 by installing a few key pieces of software and registering for certain invaluable services like Github and Slack. Beyond that, you'll start to get familiar with Github and basic source control concepts that we'll be using throughout the class. These aren't specific to any language or toolkit; they're universal developer skills.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n## Requirements\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nClick on this file in Github and use the **Raw** button to see the unrendered Markdown text. If you copy and paste the text _as is_ from the **Tasks** and **Deliverables** sections below into the **Description** of your issue, you should end up with a bunch of checkboxes, just like these, thanks to [the way that Github interprets Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). As you complete tasks, check off the corresponding checkboxes and what your progress bar fill! Read [Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) for more information on creating issues in Github.\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n### Tasks:\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n* [X] [Create a Github account](https://github.com/signup)\\\r\\\n* [X] Find and star [the class project](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/FEE--2015--SPRING)\\\r\\\n* [x] Read [the Home page on the class wiki](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/2015--SUMMER--FEE/wiki)\\\r\\\n* [x] [Create a new *WIP Issue*](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/FEE--2015--SPRING/issues/new)\\\r\\\n  * [x] Named `00 -- Brace Yourself -- YOUR NAME` (where `YOUR NAME` is _your_ name)\\\r\\\n  * [x] With this checklist as the description\\\r\\\n* [x] [Edit your Github profile](https://github.com/settings/profile) to provide:\\\r\\\n  * [x] A picture, so I can recognize your face.\\\r\\\n  * [x] Your full name, so I can recognize your name.\\\r\\\n  * [x] A valid public email address, so I can contact you if I need to.\\\r\\\n* [x] [Install Homebrew](http://brew.sh) on your Mac\\\r\\\n  * [x] Open `Terminal.app`; Don't Panic.\\\r\\\n  * [x] [Install Homebrew and the `brew` command](http://brew.sh/#install)\\\r\\\n  * [x] Read [the Homebrew Wiki](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/tree/master/share/doc/homebrew#readme) to learn more about Homebrew\\\r\\\n* [x] Using the `brew` command, install the following packages:\\\r\\\n  * [x] `zsh`\\\r\\\n  * [x] `git`\\\r\\\n  * [x] `hub`\\\r\\\n  * [x] `node`\\\r\\\n* [x] Add the output of the following commands as comments on your *WIP Issue*:\\\r\\\n  * [x] `which zsh && zsh --version`\\\r\\\n  * [x] `which git && git --version`\\\r\\\n  * [x] `which hub && hub --version`\\\r\\\n  * [x] `which node && node --version`\\\r\\\n* [x] Install the following (bonus if you use `brew`):\\\r\\\n  * [x] [Google Chrome](http://google.com/chrome)\\\r\\\n  * [x] [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash)\\\r\\\n  * [x] [Slack](http://www.slack.com)\\\r\\\n  * [x] [Atom](http://atom.io)\\\r\\\n* [ ] [Complete the \"Hello World\" Github guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)\\\r\\\n  * [ ] Add a link to your new Github repo as a comment on your *WIP Issue*\\\r\\\n* [x] Create a new repository called `TIY-Assignments`\\\r\\\n  * [ ] Check the box to create an initial `README.md` file\\\r\\\n  * [ ] Select the `CC0` -- \"Creative Commons\" license for your work\\\r\\\n  * [ ] Add a link to your `TIY-Assignments` repo as a comment on your *WIP Issue*\\\r\\\n* [ ] [Complete the \"Forking Projects\" Github guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)\\\r\\\n    * [ ] Add a link to your `Fork-and-Spoon` repo as a comment on your *WIP Issue*\\\r\\\n* [x] Install Prezto\\\r\\\n  * [ ] Find _and fork_ the Prezto project on Github; add a link as a comment on your *WIP Issue*\\\r\\\n  * [x] Use the `hub` command to clone your fork into your home directory as `.zprezto`: `hub clone prezto .zprezto`\\\r\\\n* [x] Watch _The Long Run_ Videos on [Delve.tv](http://delve.tv)\\\r\\\n   * [x] [_The Long Game_, part 1](http://delve.tv/the-long-game-part-one/)\\\r\\\n   * [x] [_The Long Game_, part 2](http://delve.tv/the-long-game-part-2/)\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n### Deliverables:\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n* [x] *WIP Issue*\\\r\\\n  * [x] named `00 -- Brace Yourself -- YOUR NAME`\\\r\\\n  * [x] with description matching **Tasks**\\\r\\\n* [x] A Github Profile with:\\\r\\\n  * [x] Intelligible picture of yourself\\\r\\\n  * [x] Your full name\\\r\\\n  * [x] A valid email address\\\r\\\n* [x] Comments on your *WIP Issue* with output from\\\r\\\n  * [x] `which zsh && zsh --version`\\\r\\\n  * [x] `which git && git --version`\\\r\\\n  * [x] `which hub && hub --version`\\\r\\\n  * [x] `which node && node --version`\\\r\\\n* [ ] Comments on your *WIP Issue* with links to your repos for\\\r\\\n  * [ ] `Hello-World`\\\r\\\n  * [ ] `TIY-Assignments`\\\r\\\n  * [ ] `Fork-and-Spoon`\\\r\\\n  * [ ] `prezto`\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n## Extracurricular Activities\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nRegardless of how good you think you are at typing, a lot of the mistakes you make at first will be simple typographic errors. If you _don't_ know how to touch type (i.e. without looking at the keyboard), start practicing _now_ with http://www.keybr.com/. If you're fairly confident in your typing ability, try working through the JavaScript lessons on http://typing.io\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\nAs I recommended to you in your interviews, there are two books that I suggest you start reading. They're both avaialble in digital format on various devices, and they're both relatively easy reads:\\\r\\\n\\\r\\\n* [_Getting Things Done_ by David Allen](http://j.mp/134jABk)\\\r\\\n* [_Pragmatic Thinking and Learning_ by Andy Hunt](http://j.mp/1D5nmu8)"
